LPCOuts is a mobile application built for Li Po Chun United World College (LPCUWC).

LPCOuts helps students securely check in and out of the school, informing their residential block supervisor whether they are inside or outside the school. When checking out, students indicate their intended destination on the app, allowing them to be reached easily in case of an emergency.
